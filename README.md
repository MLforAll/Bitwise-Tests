# Bitwise-Tests
Little C terminal program to see effect of bitwise operations

# What is this?!
This is a little C program running inside the terminal on Linux and macOS
allowing one to see the effect of one or more bitwise operators on a size_t.

The program will display the binary representation of the number before and after
the bitwise operation.

# Known Bugs
